# Setting reasonable boundaries

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of “quiet&nbsp;quitting” with “setting reasonable boundaries”, because the former phrasing is bullshit.

### Installation

1. Download: [ReasonableBoundaries.crx](https://github.com/dsandler/bacoin/blob/master/ReasonableBoundaries.crx?raw=true)
2. Choose _Window &rarr; Extensions_ (or navigate to chrome://extensions/) and drag ReasonableBoundaries.crx into the browser window.

### Credits

An updated version of [Bacoin](https://github.com/dsandler/bacoin) (which is
much funnier) which is itself adapted from [Steve
Frank's](http://stevenf.com/) classic
[cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) Chrome extension.
